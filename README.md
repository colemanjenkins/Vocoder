# Vocoder

This is a simple vocoder created for 
CS 4501, Digital Signal Processing (DSP).
The project proposal and report are in the
documentation folder for more information
on the algorithms.

The code is contained in the jupyter notebook
`DSP_Final_Project.ipynb`. In order for this to
run correctly, the files refernced must be in the
same directory that it runs in. All of the used
files are in the directory `sounds_used`.

Special thanks to Luke Dahl for the resources
that I based the code on.

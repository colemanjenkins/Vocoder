# Vocoder

This is a simple vocoder created for 
CS 4501, Digital Signal Processing (DSP).
The project proposal and report are in the
documentation folder for more information
on the algorithms. The 5 minute class presentation
can be found in the video in the root directory.

The code is contained in the jupyter notebook
`DSP_Final_Project.ipynb`. In order for this to
run correctly, the files refernced must be in the
same directory that it runs in. All of the used
files are in the directory `sounds_used`.

Special thanks to Luke Dahl for the resources
that I based the code on.
